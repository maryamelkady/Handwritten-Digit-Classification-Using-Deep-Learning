# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using deep learning. A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was designed and trained to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- **Normalized** pixel values to scale between 0 and 1.
- Applied **one-hot encoding** to labels for classification.

### Model Development
- Designed a **CNN** architecture consisting of:
  - **Convolutional layers** for feature extraction.
  - **Pooling layers** for dimensionality reduction.
  - **Dropout layers** to prevent overfitting.
- Achieved **over 98% training accuracy**.

### Model Evaluation
- Achieved **97% accuracy** on unseen test data, demonstrating the modelâ€™s effectiveness.


## Future Work
- Experiment with deeper CNN architectures for improved accuracy.
- Implement real-time handwritten digit recognition using OpenCV.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
